## Writeup
This project is a Java-based web scraper that extracts product names and prices from the MaxGaming News page. Using the JSoup library, it connects to the site, parses the HTML content, and collects relevant data. The program automatically loops through all available pages until no more product listings are found. Each product's title and price are written to a .txt file for easy access. The code can be easily modified to fit most websites with similar HTML structures.
